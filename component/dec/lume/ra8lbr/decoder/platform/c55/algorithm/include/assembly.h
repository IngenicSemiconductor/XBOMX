 * - inline rountines with access to 64-bit multiply results
 * - x86 and ARM 7 versions included
 * - some inline functions are mix of asm and C for speed (see note below)
 *
 * Inline functions
 * RA_TNI_MULSHIFT0(x, y):			signed multiply of two 32-bit integers (x and y), returns top 32-bits of 64-bit result
 * RA_TNI_MULSHIFT1(x, y):			same as RA_TNI_MULSHIFT0 but drops MSB (does << 1 on the 64-bit result then returns top 32 bits)
 * RA_TNI_MULSHIFT2(x, y):			same as RA_TNI_MULSHIFT0 but drops 2 MSB's (does << 2 on the 64-bit result then returns top 32 bits)
 * RA_TNI_MULSHIFTNCLIP(x, y, n):	signed multiply of two 32-bit integers (x and y), rescales answer by left-shifting the
 *								64-bit result by n bits and returning the new top 32 bits, saturating if necessary
 *								(useful when abs(x*y) is only rarely larger than some maximum value)
 * RA_TNI_MAKESHORT(x, y):			adds overlapping transform windows and rescales to 16-bit PCM, clipping if necessary
 * RA_TNI_BUTTERFLY(...):			butterfly loop for FFT, made into a single function because calling lots of individual
 *								multiplies from the normal C code introduces lots of function overhead
