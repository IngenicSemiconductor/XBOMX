 * Huffman coding functions.
 *
 * Huffman decoding trees are stored as array of nodes (int [2])
 * that point to child nodes (if positive) or store the leaf value
 * (if negative).  Since values can be zero, store as (-value-1)
 * to free zero to represent uninitialized nodes.
 *
 * Example, for code=6 with value=98:
 *	tree[0][1] -> 2		next node at 2
 *	tree[2][1] -> 7		next node at 7
 *	tree[7][0] -> -99	leaf! value = 99-1 = 98
