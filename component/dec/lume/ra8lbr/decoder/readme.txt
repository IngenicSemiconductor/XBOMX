Notes about ra8lbr, the 32-bit fixed-point RA8 (low-bitrate) decoder

To build the reference decoder on x86 (Windows)
-----------------------------------------------
1) open projects\visualc\gecko2.dsw in Visual C++ 6.0
2) select testwrap as Active Project
3) choose Debug or Release build
4) build gecko2.exe (F7) - the output will be in either decoder\debug or decoder\release

This workspace contains two sub-projects:
  - gecko2.dsp builds a static library (gecko2.lib) which is the actual codec
  - testwrap.dsp builds a command-line executable which links in gecko2.lib and
      provides a simple test harness for using the codec

Only the files in gecko2.dsp need to be ported to the target platform.
  These are the *.c and *.h files located in the top-level directory (decoder) and 
  optionally in the asm\[platform] subdirectories (if assembly-language files are used).

The files in testwrap.dsp (located in decoder\testwrap\*.c) are only for testing, and ARE NOT
  part of the RealAudio codec. These SHOULD NOT be included in shipping products.
  Therefore, the test wrapper can be modified to suit your particular testing needs
  (for example, implementing platform-specific functions like file I/O on a new system).


To learn more about this codec
------------------------------

Look in the decoder\docs subdirectory

To test your implementation of this codec
-----------------------------------------

Look at the readme.txt in the subdirectory testutil archive, available 
  in the rarvcode-tck project.

This will explain how to use the test utilities and sample encoded audio files 
  which are located there.
